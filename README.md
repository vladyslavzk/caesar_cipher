**Description**

The Caesar Cipher Web App is a beginner-level cyber security project that allows users to encrypt and decrypt text using the classic Caesar Cipher algorithm. The Caesar Cipher is a simple substitution cipher, where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet.

The web application provides a user-friendly interface where users can input their text, choose a shift value (encryption key), and then select whether they want to encrypt or decrypt the text. After performing the chosen operation, the app displays the resulting text.

**Technologies Used**

*Python*: The programming language used for the backend logic and encryption/decryption algorithms.

*Flask*: A lightweight web framework for Python, used to build the web application and handle HTTP requests.

*HTML*/*CSS*: The frontend user interface is designed using HTML for the structure and CSS for styling.
